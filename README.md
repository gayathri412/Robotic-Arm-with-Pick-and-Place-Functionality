# Robotic-Arm-with-Pick-and-Place-Functionality
This project features a servo-driven robotic arm capable of picking up objects from a source location and placing them at a target location. The system is controlled using an Arduino microcontroller, with movement precision achieved through programmed servo angles. 
üìå 1. Introduction
A robotic arm is a type of mechanical arm with functions similar to a human arm. This project focuses on developing a Pick and Place Robotic Arm that automates the process of picking up an object from one location and placing it at another. This mimics industrial robots used in manufacturing and packaging lines, reducing human effort and increasing productivity.

üéØ 2. Objectives
Design and build a 4-DOF robotic arm using servo motors.

Implement pick-and-place operations using an Arduino.

Simulate real-world industrial automation on a small scale.

Provide manual or automatic control of arm movement.

Demonstrate the potential of embedded systems in robotics.

Shoulder Movement (Up/Down)

Elbow Movement (Up/Down)

Gripper Open/Close

üî© 4. Hardware Components
Component	Description
Arduino UNO	Microcontroller to control servos
Servo Motors (4x)	SG90 or MG996R
Gripper Mechanism	Mechanical claw or 3D-printed part
Power Supply	5V 2A regulated power adapter
Push Buttons	For manual movement (optional)
Breadboard & Wires	For circuit connections
Base Frame	Acrylic/wooden/3D printed structure

üíª 5. Software Requirements
Arduino IDE: Programming the control logic

Servo Library: Used to control servo motors

Optional: Python Serial Interface for automation or GUI

üîÑ 6. Working Mechanism
Initialization: Arduino initializes servo positions.

Pick Phase:

Base rotates to the object.

Arm lowers, gripper closes around the object.

Move Phase:

Arm lifts and rotates to the destination.

Place Phase:

Gripper opens to release the object.

Reset Phase:

Arm returns to the home position.

Arduino Logic (Simplified):
